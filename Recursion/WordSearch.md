### **Thought Process 

#### **1. Visualize the Problem**
- Take a pen and paper. Draw a small maze, mark blocked cells, and manually try to move from the start to the destination.
- Ask yourself:
  - What happens if you hit a wall or go out of bounds?
  - What happens if you revisit a cell?
  - How do you know when you’ve reached the destination?

#### **2. Break Down the Problem**
- Think about the smallest subproblem:
  - What if the maze is just \(1 \times 1\)?
  - What if the maze is \(2 \times 2\)?
  - Can you manually write down all valid paths for these smaller cases?
- What decisions do you make at each step?  
  - Example: "Should I move up, down, left, or right?"

#### **3. Explore All Possibilities**
- **Think about choices:**  
  At each cell, you can move in multiple directions. How will you decide which direction to explore first?
  - What happens if a move leads to a dead end?
  - How will you know when to backtrack?

- **Ask yourself:**  
  - What does "backtracking" really mean here?  
  - Can I remove the last step and try a new direction?

#### **4. Base Case**
- Identify the simplest condition that ends the recursion:
  - When should you stop?
  - What do you return when you’ve reached the destination?
  - What do you return if no valid moves are left?

---

#### **5. Recursion in the Maze**
- Imagine a function that can solve a smaller maze.  
  **Ask yourself:**  
  - If you know how to solve a smaller maze (e.g., ignoring the last row), how can you use that solution to solve the larger maze?
